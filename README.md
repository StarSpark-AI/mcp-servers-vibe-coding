# Art of Vibe Coding: Building MCP Servers Workshop

Learn to build MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that extend AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Codex with custom tools, database access, and external API integrations.

## Getting Started

**Start with Part 0** to set up your development environment:

👉 [**Part 0: Environment Setup**](part0-environment-setup/README.md)

This will guide you through installing all required tools including Warp terminal, Node.js, Python, Claude Code, and PostgreSQL.
