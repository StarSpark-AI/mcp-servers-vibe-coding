## Vibe Coding Recap + Document Driven Development

- Quick vibe coding philosophy refresh
- [Document Driven Development](./document-driven-development/) deep dive:
  - Writing specs that AI can execute on
  - Prompting-friendly documentation structures
  - Examples: good vs bad project docs

## Hands-On: Build an Art Gallery Website

1. Create `art-gallery/documents/templates/` folder structure
2. Use Claude Code with the meta-template to generate React design templates
3. Create React app scaffolding (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
4. Create architecture and coding standards documents
5. Run `/init` to initialize Claude Code context
6. Build Abstract Art Gallery pages:
   - Home page: carousel, newsletter signup, event cards
   - About Us and Contact Us pages
   - Neo-modern styling with abstract theme
7. Install frontend-design plugin and enhance the design

See [Document Driven Development](./document-driven-development/) for detailed step-by-step instructions.
